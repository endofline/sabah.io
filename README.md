sabah.io
========

A hub site for all content and services related with Sabah i/o (input/output) activities.

logo gallery
------------

The **Logo Gallery** is a jQuery-based gallery using GitHub as the CDN for logos. The intention is three-fold: showcase designer work; and encourage versioning tool usage (Git!); and encourage collaboration! 

Pull requests accepted for sabah.io logo designs!
Simply add a new folder under /logos/ along with proper credits in the form of a readme file.
Additional details and requirements will be posted here.

subdomains
----------

The owner of sabah.io is offering subdomains to relevant projects for free.
If the project has sufficient public interest, we will gladly offer hosting space on a reliable server somewhere! 

under construction
------------------

The site has barely gone past proof-of-concept.

It will be up, eventually ;P 
Stay tuned!
